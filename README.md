# HackerTyperButBetter

**HackerTyperButBetter** is a fun, safe, **simulated hacking terminal** written entirely in **Python**.  
It is inspired by HackerTyper, but instead of random code being printed, **you control what happens** by typing commands.

> ⚠️ No real hacking involved. Everything is visual and simulated.

## What Is This?

This project simulates a “hacker-style” terminal experience with:

- Animated typing effects  
- Fake scans, decryptions, and payload injections  
- Interactive commands  
- Randomized output to make it feel alive  

It is designed to **look cool**, not to interact with real systems or networks.

---

## How It Works

- Written in **pure Python**  
- Uses timed character output to simulate typing  
- Includes fake IP addresses, ports, and system status  
- Completely offline and safe

## How To Run

### Replit (Recommended)

This project was **coded and tested in Replit**, and works best there:

1. Go to [Replit](https://replit.com)  
2. Create a new **Python Repl**  
3. Paste the code into `main.py`  
4. Click **Run**  
5. Start typing commands!

### Local Machine (Windows / Linux / macOS)

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed:

```bash
python --version

hackertyperbutbetter.py

python hackertyperbutbetter.py
